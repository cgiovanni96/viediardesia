  "whosection": "The project represents the degree thesis of Gabriele Ghisleni, a student of the master's programme \"Valorization of territories and sustainable tourism\" at the University of Genoa, in collaboration with \"Pietre Parlanti\", Giovanni Costa, programmer and Mattia Struzzo, editor of the graphics.\n\nThe work is based on the construction of a digitalised map of the network of paths on the hill of Santa Giulia in Lavagna: \"Le Antiche vie dell'Ardesia\" (The Ancient Slate Paths); it contains the geographical coordinates using GPS tracking and a series of points of interest.  \n\nIn order to reverse the processes of hydrogeological instability and depopulation that afflict Liguria, special attention must be paid to the maintenance of dry stone walls, which are fundamental in the processes of drainage and preservation of the territory.\n\nIn order to deal with these critical issues, an association of virtuous people, lovingly linked to the territory and the landscape, has been set up: \"Pietre Parlanti\". In recent years, thanks to them, a large part of the above-mentioned network of paths has been brought back to light. This network has a thousand-year history, made up of ingenious rural and hydraulic architecture and a breathtaking landscape. \n\nSustainable, cultural and ecological tourism based on good practices can help to partly reverse these processes that lead to inevitable land consumption. \n\nThe creation of this virtual map is precisely to underline the community importance of this area by providing those who use it with an easy-to-use spatial reading tool.\n\nIf you share these values and would like to collaborate in the implementation of the project, please contact us at:\n\nviediardesia@gmail.com"
