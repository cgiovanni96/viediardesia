“Strada dell’Oro Nero”. A recommended hike that follows the same route as the slate carriers, women who walked barefoot along the cobblestone trails carrying slabs of slate (“ciappe”) on their head, all the way from the quarries to the beach. Here they were loaded on cargo boats known as “leudi”. The trail leaves from Piazza Marconi, in Lavagna on the side of the Basilica of S. Stefano and gently winds up the hill, crossing the road several times until it arrives at the Church of S. Martino, Cogorno where you can continue with route 1-B.

This route follows the same path as route no. 1 until Santa Giulia, where you can rest in the shade of the giant, centuries-old holm-oak tree as you take in the splendid view. Continue towards Sorlana, parallel to the road, take a paved pathway that starts out flat then descends through the olive groves towards Cavi. When you get to the crossroads with the scenic road, continue down via the narrow old alleyways known as “crose” until you get to the parish church of Cavi Borgo and to the Aurelia state highway or turn left onto Via della Pineta, to go to the village of Cavi Borgo.
